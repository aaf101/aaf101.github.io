        <h2>Summer Research Internship</h2>
        <p>29 May 2023</p>
    </div>
    <p>I have just recently moved into the dorm I will be occupying at Columbia University this summer as I serve as a Research Intern at the Columbia Business School. I have never spent this much continuous time in New York City, and am super excited for this summer!</p>

    <p>I also really lucked out with the project I am assigned to. It is centered on stochastic modelling, something I have little past RA experience with, and so I am very excited for the new challenge this will pose!</p>

    <p>The dorm I got assigned to is on the 18th floor, and it absolutely towers over all the neighboring buildings. The view is truly astonishing from here, and I even have a kitchen and bathroom within the suite. I have never been much of a city person, but perhaps I will be after this summer, who knows!</p>

        <h2>Leaving My First RA Position</h2>
        <p>20 January 2023</p>
    </div>
    <p>In December of 2021, fresh off the heels of my first ever semester in college, I applied for the position of Undergraduate Researcher in the Labor Dynamics Institute at Cornell. Not thinking I would ever be considered, I was very surprised to find out I got the position and would begin the following January 2022; this was my first ever RA position, and I was beyond excited for the opportunity to begin my research journey in economics.</p>

    <p>What I learned in this position was indispensible and has forever transformed my perspective on research in economics (for the better). To any potential applicant to this position, I cannot stress further to absolutely apply, especially if you are only a budding undergrad looking to try your hand in the field of economics research.</p>

    <p>It was my enjoyment that made leaving the position all the more difficult. In my fall semester as a sophomore, I had begun also working as a research assistant (RA) for another professor (what would become two professors), and that work also proved immensely interesting. Come January 2023, I had to make the difficult decision of leaving my first RA position in the Labor Dynamics Institute. I did not want to spread myself too thin (after all, I also had to look after my academics and social life), and so I decided to consolidate my attention to just one RA position.</p>

    <p>Had it not been for my experience at LDI, who knows where I would be today. I learned so much, and was very grateful for them to have taken a risk on me as a first-semester freshman.</p>

    <h2>Friday before Econ 6090 Prelim 2</h2>
    <p>4 November 2022</p>
</div>
<p>It was the Friday before the second prelim for my first graduate course in economics EVER. It was on this very day, bleeding into November 5, 2022, that I first began truly developing this website.
</p>
<p>Wanting to take a bit of a break from the relentless microeconomic theory grind, I decided I would nevertheless do something productive, yet also fun and challenging for me. I decided I would start making this website look as good as I could make it. Taking inspiration from various friends/faculty I know who manage their own, hand-coded personal websites, I decided to embark on my own quest of self-discovery by making this website. I don't really expect anyone to ever read it, but it will nevertheless serve as a fun record of my life and interests, and maybe one day, I shall look back at it and reminisce about "the good old days," even though I'm sure those future days will be just as good.</p>
<p>And with that, dear reader, I conclude my first ever blog post to this newly constructed website of mine. Enjoy.</p>
