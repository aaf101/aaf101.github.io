<h2 style="text-align: left">A Sketch for Replication of Andrews et al. (2024)</h2>
<p>I am currently working on a replication of Andrews et al. (2024). In this replication, I develop a new measure for transfer performance inspired by the work, and then outline a proposal for utilizing Monte Carlo simulation methods to generate data and use this measure to compare traditional econometric estimation methods to black-box machine learning ones. This work is still a major work in progress, and I have been developing a working paper from this proposal more recently.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left">Columbia Business School Research Lecture</h2>
<p>From May to July 2023, I was a Research Assistant at Columbia Business School working under Professor Jing Dong. The premise of the project was the increased prevalence of AI diagnostic technologies (such as IDx-DR) has called into question how current diagnostic workflows can be altered in order to improve patient outcomes. This project took the approach of utilizing stochastic modelling and results in queueing theory to provide a proposed solution to the issue. At the end of the program, I summarized my results in a presentation given to a crowd of fellow RAs, PhD students, and faculty. The presentation, written in LaTeX Beamer, is attached below.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left">Labor Dynamics Institute Work</h2>
<p>From January 2022 to January 2023, I was an Undergraduate Researcher at the Labor Dynamics Institute at Cornell University under Professor Lars Vilhuber. In this work, I replicated numerous economics research papers submitted to a variety of American Economics Association Journals (e.g., AEJ, AER, AEP, etc.), making use of version-control softwares such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and Code Ocean. I also made heavy use of Stata, R, Python, and Matlab. Aside from replication of papers, I also contributed to the replication template used by all of the research assistants in the Replication Lab. The GitHub to said template is linked below.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left">PRIMO Research Lecture</h2>
<p>From June to August 2022, I was a PRIMO Research Fellow at the Harvard Business School, paired with Professor Kyle Myers. In that work, I performed preliminary synthetic control regressions on clinical trial data to answer the following question: Does the market overreact to deaths in gene therapy clinical trials? The position culminated in a presentation given to PRIMO fellows, as well as graduate students and faculty of HBS. The presentation, written in LaTeX Beamer, is attached below. The slides show some of the limitations of synthetic control methods.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left">Preliminary Oil Futures Literature Review</h2>
<p>I have compiled a literature review on longstanding economic research into the area of market efficiency of oil futures. With the advent of the war in Ukraine levied by Russia, a prominent oil supplier that has now been sanctioned by countless oil-consuming nations, I became interested on the wider market effect this might have on the efficiency of WTI oil futures. This compilation discusses past work dealing with wars levied by various oil producers, and the estimated effects this has had on market inefficiency. This collection of notes is still a work in progress.</p>
