<h2 style="text-align:left">Nonstandard Analysis</h2>
<p>On December 8th, 2022, I gave a brief lecture on Nonstandard Analysis open to undergraduates, graduates, and faculty. In this lecture, I constructed the hyperreals, discussed the powerful Existential Principle, and briefly motivated possible applications of nonstandard analysis to large economies.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:left">Algorithmic Fairness Modeling Work</h2>
<p>I have compiled a literature review of the field of Algorithmic Fairness, centering on work by Professor Thorsten Joachims. This literature review was typed up and linked below. The main powerful result are mathematical improvements to ranking algorithms that utilize parametric fairness principles. I then devised a toy model at the end to attempt ranking job postings for users on a job market platform utilizing an arbitrary fairness constraint.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:left">Cardinality Notes</h2>
<p>I have compiled a brief set of notes dealing with cardinality for a presentation I gave in live-lecture format on a whiteboard. My notes are attached below. They are primarily based on "Mathematics for Computer Science" by Lehman, Leighton & Meyer.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:left">Axiom of Choice Research</h2>
<p>Together with James Zhang, I researched and later gave a lecture to a group of math undergraduates as well as math faculty on the Axiom of Choice. This lecture not only motivated the existence of the Axiom of Choice, but also consisted of elaborate proofs demonstrating the equivalence of the Axiom of Choice to other assumptions, such as Zorn's Lemma, the Well-Ordering Principle, every vector space having a basis, and also a discussion of non-measurable sets, with the Vitali Set being used as a chief example. We also utilized transfinite recursion in some of our equivalence proofs.</p>
