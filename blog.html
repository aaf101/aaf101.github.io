<p>It appears you have entered my blog! On here, I write about my days (the majority of which are currently spent as a weary yet young college student, embarking on a quest for knowledge (and maybe some money, too?)</p>

    <h2>Friday before Econ 6090 Prelim 2</h2>
    <p>4 November 2022</p>
</div>
<p>It was the Friday before the second prelim for my first graduate course in economics EVER. It was on this very day, bleeding into November 5, 2022, that I first began truly developing this website.
</p>
<p>Wanting to take a bit of a break from the relentless microeconomic theory grind, I decided I would nevertheless do something productive, yet also fun and challenging for me. I decided I would start making this website look as good as I could make it. Taking inspiration from various friends/faculty I know who manage their own, hand-coded personal websites, I decided to embark on my own quest of self-discovery by making this website. I don't really expect anyone to ever read it, but it will nevertheless serve as a fun record of my life and interests, and maybe one day, I shall look back at it and reminisce about "the good old days," even though I'm sure those future days will be just as good.</p>
<p>And with that, dear reader, I conclude my first ever blog post to this newly constructed website of mine. Enjoy.</p>
