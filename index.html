<p style="padding-right:10px">Greetings! If you are looking for the website of Andr&eacute;s Aradillas Fern&aacute;ndez, look no further! I hope to take you on a journey to teach you a little bit about me, as well as showcase some of the stuff I like to do.</p>

<p>Let me start off with a little bit about me. I am a sophomore double-majoring in Mathematics and Economics at Cornell University. In my free time, I like not only learning more about math or economic theory, but also playing jazz piano. Another favored pastime of mine is learning new languages (once upon a time, I had actually intended on becoming a linguist--but that's a story for another time).</p>

<p>Within this website, you should be able to find not only information about me, but also some of my past research, as well as general thoughts on the fields and things I am interested in, on top of a few easter eggs for the eagle-eyed readers to find.</p>
