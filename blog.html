        <h2>Federal Reserve</h2>
        <p>12 August 2024</p>
    </div>
    <p>The summer is coming to an end, and so is my incredible research internship at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I met the most amazing people, interns, pre-docs, and economists alike, and have learned so much about how one of the most fundamental parts of our financial system in the US works!</p>

    <p>Besides all of the knowledge I have gained on finance, etc., one cool experience that has come out of this research internship has been getting to know an incredible class of people my age interested in economics research! Sometimes at Cornell, it feels like not many people are as interested in economics research as I am (at least, not many people my age--though that may also just be because a lot of my friends do not study economics), and so it was so refreshing to meet people as interested in economics in the same way that I am! I feel like I was really able to make some good friends, and these are definitely people I will make great efforts to keep in touch with. Thankfully, periodically submitting our Wordle scores in our group chat has proven to be quite effective in keeping us all linked together.</p>

    <p>P.S. I may not have turned into a city person after my previous internship, but this time around in NYC, I certainly have gained a greater appreciation for the non-tourist-y areas of big cities.</p>

        <h2>Summer Research Internship</h2>
        <p>29 May 2023</p>
    </div>
    <p>I have just recently moved into the dorm I will be occupying at Columbia University this summer as I serve as a Research Intern at the Columbia Business School. I have never spent this much continuous time in New York City, and am super excited for this summer!</p>

    <p>I also really lucked out with the project I am assigned to. It is centered on stochastic modelling, something I have little past RA experience with, and so I am very excited for the new challenge this will pose!</p>

    <p>The dorm I got assigned to is on the 18th floor, and it absolutely towers over all the neighboring buildings. The view is truly astonishing from here, and I even have a kitchen and bathroom within the suite. I have never been much of a city person, but perhaps I will be after this summer, who knows!</p>

        <h2>Leaving My First RA Position</h2>
        <p>20 January 2023</p>
    </div>
    <p>In December of 2021, fresh off the heels of my first ever semester in college, I applied for the position of Undergraduate Researcher in the Labor Dynamics Institute at Cornell. Not thinking I would ever be considered, I was very surprised to find out I got the position and would begin the following January 2022; this was my first ever RA position, and I was beyond excited for the opportunity to begin my research journey in economics.</p>

    <p>What I learned in this position was indispensible and has forever transformed my perspective on research in economics (for the better). To any potential applicant to this position, I cannot stress further to absolutely apply, especially if you are only a budding undergrad looking to try your hand in the field of economics research.</p>

    <p>It was my enjoyment that made leaving the position all the more difficult. In my fall semester as a sophomore, I had begun also working as a research assistant (RA) for another professor (what would become two professors), and that work also proved immensely interesting. Come January 2023, I had to make the difficult decision of leaving my first RA position in the Labor Dynamics Institute. I did not want to spread myself too thin (after all, I also had to look after my academics and social life), and so I decided to consolidate my attention to just one RA position.</p>

    <p>Had it not been for my experience at LDI, who knows where I would be today. I learned so much, and was very grateful for them to have taken a risk on me as a first-semester freshman.</p>

    <h2>Friday before Econ 6090 Prelim 2</h2>
    <p>4 November 2022</p>
</div>
<p>It was the Friday before the second prelim for my first graduate course in economics EVER. It was on this very day, bleeding into November 5, 2022, that I first began truly developing this website.
</p>
<p>Wanting to take a bit of a break from the relentless microeconomic theory grind, I decided I would nevertheless do something productive, yet also fun and challenging for me. I decided I would start making this website look as good as I could make it. Taking inspiration from various friends/faculty I know who manage their own, hand-coded personal websites, I decided to embark on my own quest of self-discovery by making this website. I don't really expect anyone to ever read it, but it will nevertheless serve as a fun record of my life and interests, and maybe one day, I shall look back at it and reminisce about "the good old days," even though I'm sure those future days will be just as good.</p>
<p>And with that, dear reader, I conclude my first ever blog post to this newly constructed website of mine. Enjoy.</p>
