<h2 style="text-align: left">PRIMO Research Lecture</h2>
<p>From June to August 2022, I was a PRIMO Research Fellow at the Harvard Business School, paired with Professor Kyle Myers. In that work, I performed preliminary synthetic control regressions on clinical trial data to answer the following question: Does the market overreact to deaths in gene therapy clinical trials? The position culminated in a presentation given to PRIMO fellows, as well as graduate students and faculty of HBS. The presentation, written in LaTeX Beamer, is attached below.</p>
