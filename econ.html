<h2 style="text-align: left">PRIMO Research Lecture</h2>
<p>From June to August 2022, I was a PRIMO Research Fellow at the Harvard Business School, paired with Professor Kyle Myers. In that work, I performed preliminary synthetic control regressions on clinical trial data to answer the following question: Does the market overreact to deaths in gene therapy clinical trials? The position culminated in a presentation given to PRIMO fellows, as well as graduate students and faculty of HBS. The presentation, written in LaTeX Beamer, is attached below.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left">Preliminary Oil Futures Literature Review</h2>
<p>I have compiled a literature review on longstanding economic research into the area of market efficiency of oil futures. With the advent of the war in Ukraine levied by Russia, a prominent oil supplier that has now been sanctioned by countless oil-consuming nations, I became interested on the wider market effect this might have on the efficiency of WTI oil futures. This compilation discusses past work dealing with wars levied by various oil producers, and the estimated effects this has had on market inefficiency. This collection of notes is still a work in progress.</p>
