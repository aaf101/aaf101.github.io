<h2 style="text-align:left">Nonstandard Analysis</h2>
<p>On December 8th, 2022, I gave a brief lecture on Nonstandard Analysis open to undergraduates, graduates, and faculty. In this lecture, I constructed the hyperreals, discussed the powerful Existential Principle, and briefly motivated possible applications of nonstandard analysis to large economies.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:left">Algorithmic Fairness Modeling Work</h2>
<p>I have compiled a literature review of the field of Algorithmic Fairness, centering on work by Professor Thorsten Joachims. This literature review was typed up and linked below. The main powerful result are mathematical improvements to ranking algorithms that utilize parametric fairness principles. I then devised a toy model at the end to attempt ranking job postings for users on a job market platform utilizing an arbitrary fairness constraint.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:left">Cardinality Notes</h2>
<p>I have compiled a brief set of notes dealing with cardinality for a presentation I gave in live-lecture format on a whiteboard. My notes are attached below. They are primarily based on "Mathematics for Computer Science" by Lehman, Leighton & Meyer.</p>
